1,ZG,will not worry to waiting ZG back to 100$ a share housing business will heading  good direction . more people will  willing buy house instate for rent .
2,ZG,"The upside for Zillow is exponential.  Have you ever tried to rent a vacation home?  First, you have to identify all of the different rental property management companies / real estate companies that offer short term vacation rentals.  Then you have to use each company's search engine to try and find the property that meets your needs in terms of location and price, which can take hours and hours trying to find the best deal.  I've always wondered why there isn't some type of search engine, like Kayak, that searches all of the real estate company rental properties at one time and provides a holistic view of all properties available with links to the real estate company to book the house .  I've also always wondered why people have to wait in line to get their keys and paperwork when they check in, instead of just driving to the vacation home and entering a security code into the door keypad to get in. Why do they have to stop at the realtor on way out of time to drop off keys when keypad would eliminated this waste of time.  Zillow purchased Trulia, but it just sits there dying on the vine.  Why not turn it into a vacation home clearing house for rental companies and home owners who want to rent their homes like ABNB does.  Wouldn't it be awesome if you could go to Trulia, enter a zip code and time frame, and all of the vacation homes available for short term rentals popped up on their map?  If you wanted to get more info or book any given property you just clicked on the property and it takes you to the real estate company or owner that manages the property?  This would save customers millions of hours a year, and give them access to all vacation properties instead of just the ones they searched on for any given real estate company.  Consumers would also be amazed at how cheap many of these vacation homes are during the off season, which is a time they don't usually look to rent the property.   After all vacation homes are added to Trulia, then add all of the restaurants to Trulia, and enable users to search by type, health dept cleanliness score, which ones have specials, type of special promotion and size of discount.  Trulia could easily become THE vacation home clearing house for all rental companies and rental property home owners.  There are dozens of ways to further monetize users of Trulia once the vacation homes and restaurants are added.  Zillow should be valued at well over $100 billion if they would just get some new blood in their senior management team and board!"
3,ZG,Z is my only green stock today‚Ä¶ up a penny a share. I should be able to retire if I make 96
4,ZG,"Does anyone have a contrarian view of the housing market?  Meaning, given the recent inflation in home prices, does anyone think things will go down or is the demand so great that there is no bottom in sight for rising prices and building costs?"
5,ZG,Don‚Äôt sell houses. Sell house selling data.
6,ZG,"Those that say never try and catch a falling knife and think that you're smart enough to catch the bottom.....are so right when it comes to Zillow!  I recently bought some ITM 2022 call options, but not very optimistic given the current trend.  I'll probably be part of the 70% that lose on options for this particular stock.  Today's announcement that home sales were much, much stronger than expected should have been a catalyst for Zillow given the presumption that they were able to unload some of their homes at better pricing than previously expected.  Obviously that's not the case this morning!"
7,ZG,when you are looking to buy or rent a house what website do you use? I dare you to find a better one then Zillow. They just need to capitalize on it more effectively
8,ZG,"ok NOBODY is buying this stock right now... would you? all that's left are bag holders who are praying it goes up a little so they can exit, which in turn clips the wings of any real bounce... so what more likey? $65 per share or $45 per share...  this thing is toxic nobody is excited about buying it... that's just the way it is......"
9,ZG,"I got MRNA and ZILLOW losing big a few weeks ago. I kept adding MRNA and ZILLOW because I used both services and believe they are world leaders. Now look at MRNA, jump 50% from its low in days. Next turn is Zillow."
10,ZG,"The big question is, what will Z do with all their cash. I read they have $2 billion in cash plus 2.5 more from selling those houses. Their next move with that 4.5billion in cash seems to be the hope for this stock."
11,ZG,"Even though $Z has been an absolute bust, It will eventually have a few green days.  No point in selling at the bottom.  At least wait for the squeeze."
12,ZG,Apart from the fact the the last couple of days have been horrible for growth stocks.I'm thinking of the explanation they gave for coming out of iBuying.  They blamed their algorithm.They could have blamed anything - cooling market - lack of trades people to do the work - supply chain issues. ANYTHING.Instead - they blamed the only bloody thing that makes this company worthwhile - the accuracy of their Zestimates and that comes from THE ALGORITHM.Gah - how hard is it to be senior management AND avoid telling the world the only thing worthwhile about your company doesn't work.     Not a short - I'm down 30% and blame the management for how they communicated pulling out of a market that wasn't working for them.
13,ZG,"What's peoples perception on this stock now it's dropped so much, buy now or will it drop even further"
14,ZG,will back to  $90 or $100 soon because  CEO taking good action for stop  buy house only sell and lay off employee . use cash buy back shares to plant ahead next move for housing business
15,ZG,"This is comical and creating an incredible buying opportunity. The stock is being punished for a great decision to exit an unprofitable business. To continue with ibuyjng would have been a destructive path. Now, the company can focus on a profitable business."
16,ZG,Loving this drop.  Finally picked up in bulk now after nibbling on $ZG $Z the past month.  Looking forward to the stock hitting $100+within the next 52 weeks.
17,ZG,"$ZG $Z is very oversold.  Regardless of the one time mistake they made on trying to get into the home buying and selling biz, they're still the leader in online real estate.  The value they bring on just the data they possess is worth $100 a share.  Ignoring the shorts and naysayer and I just doubled my position today.  GLTA longs!"
18,ZG,It would be good to see some more educated insights here and all the prophets guessing the closing price or next week‚Äôs price. Wishful thinking I guess.
19,ZG,"I don't know much about this stock, but the Fast Money guys on CNBC thought it was way oversold in the mid sixties, and I can see that its price to sales ratio is less than 3. It can't be that bad at this price ($56.65)!"
20,PLTK,target price $2
21,PLTK,"I've been bag holding since IPO at $30, really thought they would jump based on their projected earnings reports. Debating on dumping for a huge loss, especially with two law firms going for a class action."
22,PLTK,What a great short this stock is. Remember today‚Äôs lows will be tomorrow‚Äôs highs.
23,PLTK,"Wow, a bunch more law firms are filing class actions. Anyone on here reach out to any of them?"
24,PLTK,"I do not own the stock, but I play on their platform. It‚Äôs something to do. And they are in the ‚Äúboredom killing business.‚Äú Flush with pandemic earnings, they took this company public. Prematurely in my opinion. As a customer, I noticed the cost to play creeping up, not incrementally, but by orders of magnitude. What cost a few dollars last year was increased to $20 sometimes $30. And this to play on a platform where there is no real chance of winning actual cash. It‚Äôs for fun.  And boredom killing. A while ago, I attempted to post this on their Facebook page, and it was deleted. Just my opinion: Since Playtika went public, I‚Äôve noticed the inflation in cost for in-game play.  Increases in some cases as high as 400%. Also, the win percentage has dipped. And, as most of you have noticed, the side games offer impossible to achieve goals, with minuscule rewards. All designed to keep you purchasing more coins.This Forward-looking information from Playtika‚Äôs last earnings conference call confirms this.    ‚ÄúOur reliance on a limited number of games to generate the majority of our revenue;     Our reliance on a small percentage of total users to generate a majority of our revenue;     Our free-to-play business model, and the value of virtual items sold in our games, is highly dependent on how we manage the game revenues and pricing models;‚Äù PLAY ACCORDINGLY."
25,PLTK,Playtika Holding reached an all time low at 17.80
26,PLTK,"I play on this platform and in my opinion, they have taken a fun game and destroyed it for greed. Nearly impossible to play and lousy customer service...Stockholders over customers something has to give."
27,PLTK,extremely bizarre overreaction. highly profitable company with solid growth track records. thanks for selling. i was able to buy a lot today
28,PLTK,Bought some today. Hope it drop some more so I can buy some more
29,PLTK,Under 20 soon
30,PLTK,Back to $20
31,PLTK,So glad I sold months ago. I‚Äôll look at it again in 5 days. 9.00?
32,PLTK,I am holding it and just bought more.Used to work there and this company is a cash cow! They have the strongest management and best discipline that I have ever seen. IMHO Playtika is worth ateast 2 times Zynga and the real reason for this low price is that the management is still learning how to deal with public listing. They are quick learners...
33,PLTK,25 is coming
34,PLTK,TNX FOR THE DIP. LOL. SO OVERSOLD.
35,PLTK,Look at the pump from august with no news. This is going to 15s I‚Äôm watching it maybe I‚Äôll add a position 19s and lower but it‚Äôs not good
36,PLTK,This stock could be a strong buy
37,PLTK,"PLTK , 2.3B company with 23% annual grow, is a Jem in gaming industry . Hard to find!"
38,PLTK,Great company to invest
39,PLTK,Playtika Holding reached an all time low at 16.75
40,PTON,"This is a $10 stock at the very most.  If it can't make money in Year 2020, it NEVER will."
41,PTON,"The PTON Global juggernaut has finally hit rock bottom and is now ready to methodically bounce back!ü§îüëç‚ÄúThe journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step‚Äù!üôèüññüëå‚Äî The PTON Global Community continues to grow, yet; you wouldn‚Äôt know it from the ‚Äúhaters and naysayers‚Äù at every corner spewing poison on this Great American üá∫üá∏ innovative business.‚òùÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è"
42,PTON,$14B market cap for a clothes hanger company. Gotta love capitalism.
43,PTON,I have 2 question for LONGS---1) What will happen to share price the day Peleton guides down for the Fiscal Year 2022 (quarters 3 and 4) at their next earnings call?  ---The reason why is that current guidance for those 2 quarters is $2.9 Billion which would mean they would need to have 2 quarters better than their best quarter ($1.26 Bn) ever and quarter 4 is usually their worst quarter of the season?2)  What will happen to share prices once DCF growth projections regarding 10 yr hits 1.75% and above or interest hikes come in 2022?YES--MASSIVE price changes coming up in 2022....not for the better
44,PTON,who's buying this $15B bicycle company ?
45,PTON,What are the beliefs of Peloton longs?1)  Stocks only go up?2)  Strap a screen on a bike and call it a tech company?3)  DCF models are not supposed to be used with higher inflation or interest rates inputs;4)  Companies dont need profits YOLO;5)  Cults are good.
46,PTON,"How sad; the stock price couldn't even get back up to the $46/share offering price.What are the 'longs' expecting to happen, that hasn't happened already?"
47,PTON,"Last year, PTON essentially had no competition; but, this year...""The [Bowflex] C6 Bike can currently link up to a dozen different fitness apps, including both Peloton and Zwift‚Äîtwo of the market‚Äôs best rated streaming training apps you can download these days. While both Echelon and Horizon Fitness also have competitors in this space priced very close to the C6 Bike, so far it seems Bowflex is the candidate with the most diversity in terms of training options. That said, if you‚Äôre looking for something a little more closely aligned to the Peloton model for the same price as the C6, the new MYX Fitness bike has rapidly become our favorite (read the full review of the MYX Fitness Bike here)."""
48,PTON,"Even if you believe PTON is some kind of 'specialized' Facebook, compare the number of 'members' of each.PTON has like 1% the number of members Facebook has; then, calculate 1% of Facebook's Market Cap, and PTON is STILL overvalued by more than 50%"
49,PTON,big push up ahrs relatively low volume except at the top of the move...and then just like that........tomorrow will be a big day up or down
50,PTON,I bought a $100 bike and workout in front of my tv for free what‚Äôs the difference

According to the EPA, common residential indoor pollutants include excessive moisture, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), combustion products, radon, pesticides, dust particles, viruses, and bacteria."
53,PTON,Did I see a press release stating that as long as the media keeps making a big deal about viruses they would be fine financially?  Seems like a joke of a business model
54,PTON,Coming soon
55,PTON,Peloton shareholders New Years resolution:  I will cut my losses in PTON and get into a real company that has growth prospects.
56,PTON,Question - Can a short sign up with one of these class action lawsuits if he feels he should have made even more money shorting this trainwreck of a company?
57,PTON,"And why did I buy this stock yesterday?    Oh yea, I wanted to throw money away."
58,PTON,"New Peloton ‚Äòinvestment‚Äô‚Ä¶lawyers!  Lululemon on Monday filed an anticipated patent lawsuit against Peloton, in a growing feud over the designs of its sports bras and leggings.  In the suit, filed in the Central District of California, Lululemon said it is seeking injunction against Peloton‚Äôs infringement of its intellectual property rights. It‚Äôs also asking for damages and other monetary relief."
59,PTON,Back to $23-27 she will go.  FYI.

62,ROL,Rollins is down 5.14% to 37.31
63,ROL,Rollins management doesn‚Äôt care about some analysts ‚Äúguess.‚Äù  They will continue to grow revenue and profit.
64,ROL,History shows it is a Great time to buy. ROL should be back to its 52 week high within the next 60 days. There is a great chance it will also split either 3 for 2 or 2 for 1.
65,ROL,any reason why ROL stock jumped down from 58 to 38?
66,ROL,"ROL always recovers after a major drop. Should easily hit the new ""Target Price"" ($40.10) a 9% increase; and then grow back to the $44.00 range (another 10% increase)."
67,ROL,Rollins has 51% insider stock. Is that a good or bad sign? Pros is that stock will be less volatile. Is my thinking correct?
68,ROL,is it good to buy now or wait? the financial statements look very strong
69,ROL,Anyone have new information on this stock? Why the drop? Why the split?
70,ROL,"Rollins, Inc. $ROLTotal Debt (mrq)	369.53MRollins, Inc. $ROLBook Value Per Share (mrq)	2.01"
71,ROL,Get on the bandwagon. Another great year for ROL. Notice they raised the one year ‚Äútarget price‚Äù.
72,ROL,Seems to be a pretty high multiple for a pest control business; I guess it's flatlining for a while. It may be worthwhile to $-cost average into it for 2k shares... It will certainly help diversify my portfolio!
73,ROL,Just as I said ROL always bounces back and never misses a 52 week Target Price. Since February 6th ($46.86) it is up almost 10% February 26th ($51.42).
74,ROL,why this stock doesn't go anywhere
75,ROL,"With all the storms and bugs getting bigger, this stock should be hitting new highs everyday. In & buying."
76,ROL,"Thoughts on earnings? Seems like this company misses more than not, yet stock has always recovered."
77,ROL,"Great company and great stock, we will see $70 by the end of the year üòÅ"
78,ROL,Today is a great day to buy ROL. It should be back in between $52.00 and $54.00 by mid-May. That equates to a 5 - 10% increase. Get on the ‚Äúbandwagon‚Äù.
79,ROL,I entered at 39.90...anyone higher than me? any insights will be welcome

120,NVAX,"For those concerned about the lack of recent PR by NVAX I offer the following perspectives for why I am not concerned:(1) With the large number of lawsuits proposed against the Company, the Corporate attorneys are assuredly preventing any press releases or quotes that contain any conjecture or non-fact based assertions on the part of management.  Management especially will not make any comments about the NVAX vaccine effectiveness against Omicron without supporting scientific data.  They also will not comment about the timing of any EUA approvals since these decisions are completely in the hands of the various country regulatory bodies.(2) We all know the saying ""buy the rumor, sell the news"".  Well, since complete filings/applications have now been made in numerous countries the rumor is that EUA approvals are coming soon in numerous countries.  This is an extremely positive rumor.  If there are negative rumors out there, anything that were to come of those rumors that have a material, adverse impact on the Company would need to be disclosed to investors.  Given no such disclosure we can infer no such material, adverse event has occurred.  (3) There are multiple, positive catalysts that could expedite the pending approvals.  These include obviously the new Omicron variant and governments (under pressure from politicians) that want to avoid another economic slowdown/shutdown, and the stagnation in vaccination rates around the world driven in large part by vaccine hesitancy/distrust of the new vaccine technology.Just my two cents for those who are interested.  And, by the way, I added on the dip today."
121,NVAX,"Is This Latecomer a Better Buy Than Moderna and Pfizer?Its big moment may be only a few weeks away.Key Points	‚Ä¢	Moderna and Pfizer lead the U.S. vaccine market.	‚Ä¢	But there‚Äôs room for a latecomer with a different technology.	‚Ä¢	Share price catalysts include regulatory decisions and reports of real-world performance.Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) dominate the coronavirus vaccine market. Each has generated quarterly vaccine revenue in the billions. And they expect to report annual vaccine revenue of as much as $18 billion and $36 billion, respectively. Johnson & Johnson also sells a coronavirus vaccine. But the company has remained a distant rival since that product's authorization.But the vaccine market soon may welcome another competitor. And that competitor has a potential vaccine that could carve out a decent share of the market. Now, the question is whether, right now, this latecomer represents a better buy than today's leaders. Let's find out.Not a stranger to the spotlight? So, which player am I talking about? None other than Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX). The company is far from a stranger to the spotlight. The U.S. awarded the biotech $1.6 billion in funding in the early days of the vaccine race -- and a contract for the delivery of 100 million vaccine doses. Novavax fell behind due to struggles with its manufacturing ramp up. But in recent weeks, the company completed regulatory filings to various countries. And it's even won authorization from Indonesia and the Philippines.Novavax plans on filing for authorization in the U.S. before the end of the year. A decision could come a few weeks later. But can Novavax still benefit this late in the game?I think so. And here's why. Novavax's potential product is different from the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. The candidate isn't an mRNA vaccine. That means it doesn't include mRNA to instruct the body to produce a copy of the coronavirus spike protein -- that's the protein used to infect. Instead, Novavax's candidate falls into the category of protein subunit vaccines. It includes a genetically engineered spike protein in nanoparticle form along with an adjuvant to boost immune response.Some healthcare providers and individuals hesitate to go for a new technology like mRNA. And this is where Novavax can gain market share. Subunit vaccines already are on the market -- an example is the hepatitis B vaccine. This is a long-proven technology. So those who are hesitant about going for a coronavirus jab may more easily opt for Novavax.The temperature differenceAlso, Novavax's candidate is stable at refrigerator temperatures. Moderna and Pfizer vaccines can only be stored at those levels for a month. After that, they require freezer temperatures.Novavax also may get a lift from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's authorization of vaccine ""mixing and matching."" That means anyone who has received a primary series of one authorized vaccine brand may choose the same brand or another when it's time for a booster.And finally, Novavax won't be left behind when it comes to dealing with variants of concern. A Novavax spokesperson told The Hill that the company has begun development of a candidate targeting the omicron variant. Health officials first detected omicron in South Africa early last month. Since, it's spread to other areas including Europe and North America.Now, let's look at Novavax's stock price. It climbed more than 12% last month. From here, Wall Street predicts the stock could increase 30%, according to the average 12-month price forecast.Year-to-date, Moderna has soared past Novavax. Pfizer remains the laggard. (That's almost expected. Pharmaceutical companies aren't as sensitive to vaccine news as their biotech rivals. That's because they depend on the sales of many products -- so they aren't as reliant on just one.) So, which is the better buy?Novavax is particularly interesting at today's level. That's because several catalysts lie ahead: regulatory authorization in various markets including the U.S., vaccine rollout, and real-world data once a product is on the market. Any positive data on how Novavax fares against the omicron variant also could offer a lift.I'm positive on Moderna and Pfizer over the long term. But they've already been through the vaccine authorization and launch stage -- and reaped the rewards of share performance. In the coming months, it may be Novavax's turn. That's why this biotech stock may represent a better buy right now."
122,NVAX,"Seems like a strong vote of confidence in Novavax   ""Fujifilm to double size of Teesside plant that makes Covid vaccine""		https://www.ft.com/content/d4b5a9e4-3af3-4132-8b84-6c02fab6fa5b	Despite showing strong phase 3 results at the start of the year, the Novavax vaccine has not yet been approved in the UK, where it was recently submitted to regulators, or the US, after problems with providing consistent manufacturing information. Meeson said he did not know what the problems had been but Fujifilm had been able to quickly start producing what was requested and had delivered ‚Äúseveral scores of batches around the world‚Äù."
123,NVAX,"We have discussed how the mRNA platforms will be hard-pressed to make multivalent vaccines due to their harsh safety profile. This is especially hard if they want to move into the flu market where the current best vaccines, FluZone and FluBlok, include four different virus strains.Sanofi makes that point clear in their investor presentation below, slides 30 and 31. https://www.slideshare.net/Sanofi/presentation-part-1-growing-current-businessThe Novavax platform based on Matrix-M is well-suited to make multivalent vaccines. The Nanoflu phase-3 trial showed that the vaccine, using four virus strains, was superior to FluZone in both antibodies and cellular responses with a benign safety profile."

125,NVAX,"Lots of discussion of MM/algorithmic manipulation in the past few days so I thought i'd share a relevant analysis.  This is all my opinion.  There is a possible elliot wave on the chart of the prior month.  The trading strategy is commonly used by trading algorithms because it is easy to code and it engineers a predictable churn that delivers a high return.  Elliot waves occur naturally without algos. But when identified, algos can amplify and exploit them.  The tricky bit is finding A) a stock with low enough float so SP can be influenced and B) identifying the starting point of a natural wave to deploy the strategy.  A marked feature of Elliot Waves is a choppy SP (sound familiar?). Before any NVAX submissions, I spotted these waves almost daily on the intraday inside the pennants/triangles that were so prevalent at the time.  I was excited and posted about it from time to time, but those posts were not well received by ""true longs"" so I stopped sharing and made money off them. I stopped seeing them on the intraday following the initial Merck pill news preceding the Oct lows.  In my experience, major news events destroy patterns, including waves.  Minor news events are either amplified or washed out depending on if they are aligned with the natural wave's direction (sound familiar?)The current wave would be the second consecutive wave since the Oct lows (reset event, which would give algos an obvious starting point) following the Merck pill news.  Considering the prevalent use of factorials in algo trading, it would fit the profile of an algorithm to switch from trading waves intraday to intra month following a reset event. The timing is perfect.  The 2 waves are almost textbook.  Sadly, I missed the first one.  If this current wave plays out, we're nearing the end of a corrective phase and ready for the next motive phase. The timing is congruent with pending approvals.  We would need one more lower low (compared to recent SP) and reversal to confirm.  I'm sharing because why not.  If the algos are exploiting an intermediate-term wave, I just need to buy/hold and be patient. This is not investment advice.  But theoretically, if more people did the same they would exploit the algorithms too ;)TLDR: Might have a short leg down to set up a technical launchpad.  Might not. But if this happens, I consider it evidence that algorithmic trading exerts a significant force on NVAX SP.  The action would fit the profile of a common algorithmic trading strategy and would be extremely bullish for an oddball safe haven stock unless there is major and unexpected negative news."

161,Z,will not worry to waiting ZG back to 100$ a share housing business will heading  good direction . more people will  willing buy house instate for rent .
162,Z,"The upside for Zillow is exponential.  Have you ever tried to rent a vacation home?  First, you have to identify all of the different rental property management companies / real estate companies that offer short term vacation rentals.  Then you have to use each company's search engine to try and find the property that meets your needs in terms of location and price, which can take hours and hours trying to find the best deal.  I've always wondered why there isn't some type of search engine, like Kayak, that searches all of the real estate company rental properties at one time and provides a holistic view of all properties available with links to the real estate company to book the house .  I've also always wondered why people have to wait in line to get their keys and paperwork when they check in, instead of just driving to the vacation home and entering a security code into the door keypad to get in. Why do they have to stop at the realtor on way out of time to drop off keys when keypad would eliminated this waste of time.  Zillow purchased Trulia, but it just sits there dying on the vine.  Why not turn it into a vacation home clearing house for rental companies and home owners who want to rent their homes like ABNB does.  Wouldn't it be awesome if you could go to Trulia, enter a zip code and time frame, and all of the vacation homes available for short term rentals popped up on their map?  If you wanted to get more info or book any given property you just clicked on the property and it takes you to the real estate company or owner that manages the property?  This would save customers millions of hours a year, and give them access to all vacation properties instead of just the ones they searched on for any given real estate company.  Consumers would also be amazed at how cheap many of these vacation homes are during the off season, which is a time they don't usually look to rent the property.   After all vacation homes are added to Trulia, then add all of the restaurants to Trulia, and enable users to search by type, health dept cleanliness score, which ones have specials, type of special promotion and size of discount.  Trulia could easily become THE vacation home clearing house for all rental companies and rental property home owners.  There are dozens of ways to further monetize users of Trulia once the vacation homes and restaurants are added.  Zillow should be valued at well over $100 billion if they would just get some new blood in their senior management team and board!"

ANYTHING.Instead - they blamed the only bloody thing that makes this company worthwhile - the accuracy of their Zestimates and that comes from THE ALGORITHM.Gah - how hard is it to be senior management AND avoid telling the world the only thing worthwhile about your company doesn't work.

185,LMND,"Lemonade's acquisition of Metromile is a colossal blunder and reflects managements desperation to deflect attention away from their failing business by buying another failing business. This proves beyond doubt that Root should be trading @ 4 billion market NOW. Here's why. 1st) LMND's letter to shareholders/investors is a complete misrepresentation of the facts. (1st link below) Notice the footnote that states Metromile has 291 million in cash, restricted cash & restricted securities as of June 30, 2021. Today Metromile only has 159 Million in actual cash for corporate use (2nd link below). By LMND's own estimate the earliest this deal could close is in the 2nd quarter next year. At Metro's current burn rate it will only have about 90 million in cash on hand and no empirical evidence that any of Metro's modeling works. If fact, the evidence is it doesn't work because losses are increasing. Hence, the huge loses with management and major shareholders bailing out. There are no synergies because both companies admit all employees, equipment, rentals... will be kept along with Metro's burn rate. (3rd link metros sec letter on merger).In conclusion, my takeaway is LMND's takeover of Metro is the blind leading the blind. I project 1/19 share swap will cost LMND about 7-10 million shares in dilution depending on how many convertible shares Metro has. This translates into 530 million dollars for 10M shares at Tuesday's close @ $52.84 minus at settlement 90M cash of Metros leaves a purchase price of 440 million dollars. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1691421/000169142121000092/lemonadexmetromileinvest.htmhttps://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1819035/000162828021023376/mile-20210930.htmhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819035/000121390021060954/ea151128-425_metromile.htm"

212,DNA,I just need to make it two more days with dna under 15 dollars and I'll get to keep my stake in the company. next year should be really good. cronos is a bigger deal than people think and who knows what they'll get into while that's panning out?!
213,DNA,Long term hold.  Wood has been right about most picks and this stock will go higher just need to be patient.
214,DNA,Interesting company but too early to buy with a marketcap of about 25 billion(!)
215,DNA,Bought common and Calls today. Best of Luck to all
216,DNA,"I‚Äôm really interested in seeing what the aldevron royalties, motif foods equity, and Cronos deal looks like. People are ignoring the fact of downstream value and royalties. That‚Äôs not in the estimates. The revenue and ebidta estimates are only the foundry and that will be basically just used to pay for any expenses. The downstream value is the purpose of this company. Royalties and equity= 100% contribution margins. 100% profit."

219,DNA,Lot of good news in the ER
220,BHG,So today's PR says the clinic business is expected to be 2 billion in revenues in 2022 plus the new markets and recent open enrollments.  So what are we expecting in 2022?  Maybe 6 to 8 billion in revenues?  And another year of staggering growth?
221,BHG,What about the investigation?
222,BHG,"There has been a lot of worry in past few days about the 180 day lockup waiting period expiring on December 1st, 2021 allowing all insiders of the company to be free to trade eligible shares beginning on 12/2/2021.   This is according to the latest 8K filing on 11/26/21.   I am assuming that the lifted waiting period applies to all the stock options and preferred shares that were awarded to various insiders at the time of the IPO as evidenced by the multitude of Form 3s dated 6/24/2021?   I am far from an expert and quite likely might be understanding it all incorrectly‚Ä¶. But reading through the form 3s, they are either split into preferred series A,B,C,D,etc shares that convert into 1:3 common shares or 1:0.678 at IPO time (with no expiration date) or they are stock options that vest over 4 years with 25% that is already vested as of May 2021.  The exercise of these options appears to be all either at $1.773 or $2.30.   And most appear to expire during the year 2030.      I really do not see a risk with all of the insiders jumping over each other to try to either exercise their options and/or sell some of their preferred shares that were converted to common beginning on 12/2/2021.  While the total share count will amount to many dozens of millions of shares across the dozens of insiders, the current price per share is TOO LOW to make it worthwhile for them‚Ä¶  While it is possible that they could still choose to sell (especially those that were granted actual and vested convertible preferred shares), with the sheer volume of insider shares, the PPS will rapidly drop to the sub penny level with a mere few million shares sold, depending on the selling pressure. I believe most if not all will choose not to sell or otherwise if they still sell, they will not make much money.  My take is that most have worked too hard to bring the company to where it‚Äôs at and most are willing to wait for a much better pay day.  They are already disheartened that the initial $17 IPO ‚Äúmarket‚Äù price is now only a bit above $3.  The investment firms inflated the initial IPO price and possibly profited handsomely with the share drop but all the insiders were left holding the bag along with the retail buyers. I do not see a large risk with the insiders selling very soon with the current PPS at around $3.25 as of the writing of this post.  I would have worried if today‚Äôs share price was in the $teens.   If I had an exercisable price of $1.77 or $2.30, I would consider selling some shares in the $12-$13 range, why not?  I wouldn‚Äôt do it with the current PPS.  Also, I do not believe the ‚Äútax selling‚Äù season will cause many to sell before 12/31/21.  Many have already given up and sold!  The price is down around  80% since the IPO after all!I had sold my positions in the high $3 range yesterday early morning but I will definitely consider buying again and I got lucky to be able to buy at a cheaper price.  Next time, I will hold for better or for worse.  BHG is trading like it is worthless and going out of business.  It is not!    It will bounce back furiously when no one expects it."
223,BHG,I don‚Äôt any investors will sell below their price point ..which is around 7 or 10 bucks ..I dont see much issue on lock expiration but tax loss selling is the Amin issue ..and this will be dev up first week of Jan ..
224,BHG,Nice bit of news out today regarding Neuehealth division expecting to grow significantly in 2022!  Related 8K out as well.
225,BHG,"Experts, at what level should I look to add to the long I hold from 4 ? I have 2 units in this already and the most I put into a single name is 5 units. Serious answers please !!! Don't bash the stock. Everyone can see it has traded terribly . Will insiders buy when the lock up period ends ? Can this be taken private and delisted ?"
226,BHG,this will rebound strongly mid 2022. i guess now unpredictable bottom due to a new strain of Covid and selloff of dow.  everything is about Cost of treatments.

229,BHG,"Just Buy before it Rockets Up.

230,BHG,Bright Health is up 12.01% to 3.73
231,BHG,Who ever is comparing BHG to oscr/clov please don‚Äôt compare ..there is lot of difference with BHG compared to oscr and clov..
232,BHG,The expectation of capital raise has hurt this stock. But from what we see the total revenue of 5b in 2022 and higher premium per person should help the SP.  Compare to clover this trades at discount
233,BHG,"What is wrong, total cash $1.29 billion"
234,BHG,"You gotta love love traders, so-called investors or the market if you will, reacts to various news.  Arguably due to the latest new covid variant scare, BHG is down as of the writing of this post about 9.5% while CLOV is up about 2%.  go figure...  CLOV subscribers are immune to covid?  CLOV's medical costs will not increase, only BHG will be affected?   LOL..."
235,BHG,All time low every day. I don't know if this can recover anytime sooner.
236,BHG,Finally!  Halted up!
237,BHG,The lockup period ends December 1st. The excessive amount of stock given to wall street and insiders are eligible to be sold soon. It could be a blood bath the rest of the year.
238,BHG,Cash per share is $2 and book value is $3 totaling $5. But SP is $4.41. Is it worth putting college tuition savings here to grow? Pros please advise

244,PSFE,Average stock price 3.65 down about 15k. Options over the next 3 years at about even. I am good. Let them manipulate the stock where they will. In the end I will win big. If you do no gamble in the market you just make a living. I like to win. I would not continue daily buying. When you do you are helping them manipulate the stock. I am good here with averaging down and think it is a good play but not going to help them. Just going to watch. When and if they force it down more I will be playing. Good luck all.
245,PSFE,Wouldn‚Äôt e surprised to see this move to the 4-4.50 range going into the conference next week. As long as the market doesn‚Äôt collapse. Anything positive we could move up to 5. Either way I‚Äôm waiting until after the conference to sell some for tax purposes.

315,SAVA,"I have published several comments in SA today relative to some SA authors that are inexperienced by claim to be experts and write technical reviews of science they don't understand.  Below is my latest for the sake of this forum.  If you disagree you are welcome to disagree.  But if you do disagree, show me the hard data.  Data talks and opinions walk.  Let the real scientists work this out.  Here's my latest posting on SA:@Biotech Beast   It is very, very common for data to be omitted from presented data and that means nothing relative to intent, and certainly does not mean fraud.  Fraud is a very difficult thing to prove especially with scientific data.  The only way to get to the truth is to let the real scientists argue this in conferences and in the technical papers.  Those that want to take this into the court of public opinion are, in my judgement, suspicious at best.  I have published and presented at technical conferences dozens and dozens of times so I know of what I say.  Scientists themselves frequently disagree.  Disagreements and true data that proves one side is right over the other is the ONLY WAY to resolve this.  I know of very few technical subjects that I have been involved with over 40 years as a scientist that didn't have pationate opinions on at least two sides of the issue.  The problem here is that there are too many people making comments about things that they, let alone the scientists, really don't understand.  If you truely believe there is fraud, then show your conflicting data and publish it in a respected journal and let the real scientists pick it apart.  That is true science.  Show your blots of your testing of Simufilm.  Don't have that data, then you have nothing.   My experience is that real science cannot be achieved in the court of public opinion, so all these self decscribed experts with there uninformed opinons would be well suited to keep their opinions to therselves unless they have real data......and then publish it in a respected journal.

AMGN, if I'm not mistaken, has been given a fast-track pathway to approval....and we also should be given similar concessions....as the more robust data for both companies unfolds, one may be a more clear winner....but the data confirmations are patient-dependent and will read out several quarters from now.I like our odds.

Full regular abstracts were posted tothe AACR meeting website on March 10 with clinical trial and late-breaking abstracts to bereleased at the start of the conference, and in this note we highlight several important datapresentations for our coverage list and other data of interest. In addition, an itinerary of allrelevant presentations to our coverage list and the wider oncology landscape is appended atthe end of this note.In particular, we highlight:‚Ä¢ Incyte (INCY $83.18; Outperform) will be providing the first clinical update with thecompany‚Äôs A2A/A2B receptor inhibitor and hosting a conference call with investors(on Monday, April 12) to discuss the company‚Äôs broader adenosine targeting strategy,including a CD73 antibody. The adenosine pathway has garnered significant industryinterest, and therapies targeting this pathway have led to monotherapy responses,although clear clinical development paths have yet to be established, in our opinion.‚Ä¢ The next data point for TIGIT antibodies will come from iTeos (ITOS $34.54), which willpresent preliminary Phase I data with EOS884448 as a monotherapy. Recent managementcommentary suggests pharmacodynamic effects of EOS884448 will be focused on theperiphery for the AACR presentation, with biopsy analysis coming later in the year. Recallother TIGIT antibodies have shown minimal activity as a monotherapy, with the mostapparent benefit coming when combined with PD-(L)1 antibodies in PD-L1‚Äìpositivepatients. The company will also host an investor call on Monday, April 12.‚Ä¢ Agenus (AGEN $2.89; Outperform) will provide an update from the ongoing trialevaluating the combination of AGEN1181, a next-generation CTLA-4 antibody withFc enhancements, and balstilimab, the company‚Äôs PD-1 antibody. As of February, thecompany reported a 23% response rate (5/22 patients), achieving responses in tumorsunlikely to respond to PD-(L)1 antibody monotherapy, including microsatellite stablecolorectal and endometrial cancers. We will host a call with Agenus management onSaturday, April 10, to discuss the updated results (see page 5 for registration link).‚Ä¢ Although mainly preclinical in nature, several companies will provide updates on KRASG12C inhibitors, attempting to improve on the results presented to date by Amgen(AMGN $249.10; Market Perform) and Mirati (MRTX $173.91). In particular, the abstractsfocus on proposed combination regimens, with preclinical efficacy reported for severalcombinations targeting the MAPK pathway.AgenusAgenus will present updated clinical data with the company‚Äôs novel Fc-enhanced CTLA-4 antibody, AGEN1181, for which thecompany has previously disclosed multiple confirmed responses as monotherapy and in combination with the PD1 antibodybalstilimab. As of the most recent update, the combination of AGEN1181 and balstilimab resulted in a 23% response rate(5/22) across a variety of tumor types, including many that would not be expected to respond to PD-(L)1 monotherapy, suchas microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC) and MSS endometrial cancer. These particularly tough-to-treat cancertypes do not respond to PD-(L)1 monotherapy, making the initial data for AGEN1181 combination more impressive. Two MSSendometrial cancer patients have achieved responses, one on monotherapy AGEN1181 and a second on the combination withbalstilimab. In addition, a confirmed partial response in an MSS CRC patient treated with the combination was also announcedin February of this year.

448,CRON,"With sentiment perhaps as low as it can be, we think a big M&A deal could be in the works, with Altria potentially buying the remaining shares outstanding of Cronos Group. This is an idea we have been discussing with subscribers at our 420 Investor premium service for several months now, and we think it makes a great deal of sense. Predicting the timing of such a transaction, though, is always a challenge. Before we explain why we think this could happen next week, we will discuss the history and detail our rationale for the deal.HistoryIt was almost three years ago that Altria announced its strategic investment into Cronos Group: Altria Buys 45% of Cronos Group for C$2.4 billion with Option to Take Controlling StakeThe deal, which closed in March of 2019, infused the company with approximately US$1.8 billion, with Altria paying C$16.25 (about US$12), a price that was characterized as a 41.5% premium to the 10-day volume-weighted average price as of November 30, 2018. Altria also acquired warrants at C$19 that would give it majority ownership if exercised. Additionally, it took control of the Board of Directors. Altria made Cronos Group its exclusive partner for pursuing cannabis opportunities globally.Since the deal has closed, the companies have seemingly worked very well together, though both have seen their shares decline since the announcement:The warrants that Altria holds are now out of the money, as Cronos Group is trading at 65% below the C$19 exercise price, and they expire in just 16 months.Why the Deal Makes SenseWe believe that Cronos Group is a good strategic fit for Altria, which continues to look beyond tobacco for growth. With a quarter remaining in 2021, Altria is expected to generate revenue of $21.6 billion, up just 4% from a year ago. Analysts currently forecast little or no top-line growth for the next several years. Over the past 5 years, it has seen revenue increase just 12%, though earnings growth has been a bit higher (9% compound annualized growth over 5 years). Cronos Group has followed a different path than most of its peers, pursuing an ""asset-light"" strategy. As of Q2, its entire investment in fixed assets was $193 million, and its inventory was less than $36 million. The company didn't overbuild for the Canadian market. Its cash balance was $1.1 billion at mid-year, with no debt whatsoever. Cronos Group has pursued an investment into cannabinoids produced by yeast fermentation and has been focused on markets outside of Canada, particularly Israel and the U.S., where it has CBD operations as well as a recent investment in an option to acquire a minority stake in MSO PharmaCann. It has also pursued investment into consumption device research.Altria has a market cap of $83 billion. Adding in net debt, the enterprise value is $108 billion. Cronos Group is quite small relative to Altria, with a market cap of $2 billion (less than 3% of Altria) and an enterprise value of $900 million roughly (less than 1% of Altria). Our point is that even paying a 75% premium for the equity of Cronos Group ($9.25) would cost the company $2.5 billion net of cash or less than 3% of its enterprise value. This is less than a single quarter of operating income for the company. The financial impact on its own P&L and balance sheet would be minimal. Since the company owns 156.6 million shares (42%) already, the actual cost to acquire the remainder of the company would be substantially lower. In fact, the $2 billion required to buy the remaining shares of Cronos at $9.25 would be $2 billion, which is less than the cash balance at Altria as of 9/30. Of course, a deal could be at a different price and could be stock-based rather than in cash. Our point is that this is rather insignificant financially to Altria.Because Altria owns less than half of Cronos Group, it doesn't consolidate the results in its financials. Instead, the financials reflect only the changes in the carrying value of the investment. The fact that Altria's investment has deteriorated is already reflected in its financials.With the stock price low, especially in light of a still tremendous cash balance relative to the market cap, buying Cronos is less about near-term financial benefits for Altria than doubling down on its strategic vision. The companies have worked closely now for almost three years, and we believe that Cronos Group is likely much more limited than the combined company would be in pursuing more deals like the PharmaCann transaction. Altria's larger size will allow a more aggressive investment into the American cannabis industry over the next few years. The original plan to acquire control of the company by exercising warrants is now at risk with the warrants way underwater and running out of time. Altria would be prudent, in our view, to rethink its position and buy the balance of Cronos Group now.A Potential Clue on th"

It changes nothing the goodwill was always there, they are just choosing to write down the assets that haven‚Äôt been the most valuable cleaning up their books."

455,FFIE,"People are overreacting to today's developments... NASDAQ is going to place ffie on a non-compliant list because they did not yet file their last quarterly 10 q.This was actually expected and anticipated by the company's announcements/developments wrt having a special external investigation performs before being able to file financials.This was something brewing for a while, the NASDAQ action just takes effect now....No reason for after hours market to react like this is a surprise negative"
456,FFIE,The only news posted on FFIE are different law firms looking into the company.Does not give me confidence in the company.
457,FFIE,Ten months ago FFIE was at 18.45 per share.   Now it's at 6.12 in Friday's after market trading.  That is about 1/3 of the price just 10 months ago.   This does not give a shareholder a feeling of confidence.

466,FFIE,After hr 10% down. Saw their videos and they are still under construction on their building. How can you produce a car when the building is not up and running??
467,FFIE,Is it a good idea to short at $6.22?
468,FFIE,"I know why they are late after some research. Yes there is an reason and it's a good reason. No it is not fishy. I can not say it in public though. One thing I can tell you is this company is doing very well. Folks, hold your stocks and you will be surprised in the near future!"
469,FFIE,What I don't understand is why this company is not filing a 10 q
470,FFIE,"FFIE hit a new all time low of 6.40 today.It's doing the Limbo Rock, how low can it go."
471,FFIE,I don't worry. FF has better IP. It will win sooner or later
472,FFIE,"They issued so many shares, and issued debt, so they loaner can short the stock. I see no reason to own this."

485,SWI,Monday predictions?
486,SWI,"It does not appear investors really understand what happened here. This is much more serious than what is being reflected by the stock price. Hackers not only breached SolarWinds network, but they appear to have been able to breach their source code repository for at least one of their key products. They then appear to have been able to modify the code without detection. Then it appears that code was published into production by SolarWinds themselves and made available to their thousands of customers in the form of updates. Government agencies and enterprise level organizations have robust IT departments and information data security policies that adhere to best practices guidelines that are published by various organizations. These best practices always recommend keeping critical applications patched and up to date. Furthermore, companies like SolarWinds who do business with the government and enterprise level entities generally follow best practices associated with releasing software patches and updates. These practices almost always require the software company to publish an MD5 hash that allows the customer to verify that the patch or update they have downloaded and are going to apply/install, is genuine. This is done to prevent a customer from downloading a malicious patch that was produced by a third party hacker. In other words, the MD5 hash allows the customer to verify the patch was generated by their vendor and not by a malicious third party.In this case, the vendor appears to be the one that published the malicious patch/update. This goes well beyond negligence and creates enormous liability for SolarWinds.  Government agencies, security firms, tech companies and other enterprise level organizations appear to have been impacted. There is potentially untold billions of dollars in liability that SolarWinds faces, much more than any insurance policy is going to cover. This event is not going to just be reflected in a bad quarter. This is going to reverberate at this company for many years to come and could spell their ultimate demise.The content of this post are my personal opinion based on my general understanding of software development lifecycles, information data security best practices and public information about the SolarWinds hack."
487,SWI,"Where have managers and IT guys during the hack? Most likely, they worked from home watching movies and trading stocks rather working on their jobs: monitor the network and logs."

499,OTLY,"Love Oatly oatmilk to consume and a big backer of the company. I love their products. But when I see a 1/2 gallon of Oatly Original being sold for $1.99 due to delivery/supply issues, it makes me wonder. I normally pay around $5/ per half gallon and they're dumping it at a loss or close?  There is going to be a consequence."

Price: 14.93, Change: -0.27, Percent Change: -0.02. MT Newswires does not provide investment advice."
535,TGTX,"Here is an interesting finding by McKinsey regarding their analysis of the results of FDA advisory committees: As shown in Exhibit 2a, the FDA‚Äôs approval decisions have been broadly consistent with the recommendations of its advisory committees. The FDA approved 88% of the original NDAs or BLAs that were endorsed by its advisory committees, and did not approve 86% of those that the committees did not endorse. In addition, in those instances when the approval decision made by the FDA differed from the recommendation of the advisory committee, the FDA did so at the same rate regardless of whether the panel endorsed approval. The sensitivity and specificity of advisory committee recommendations as a test for FDA approval is 96% and 67%, respectively. In addition, at 78% of advisory committee meetings the members recommended drug approval."
536,TGTX,"The BLA for MS should be expected anytime now. I did not listen to the CC so if this was mentioned, someone please confirm this.The data for MS is different and the trials met the primary and secondary end points as per the SPA accepted by FDA. The MS opportunity is bigger than CLL and should the MS be approved (most likely, given the data) the SP should rise to yesterday's levels or more based on the MS only.For newcomers it is a good entry point."

538,TGTX,Paraphrasing Mike W... this is an early OS and not indicative of the actual when data is more mature. Other approved drugs had similar early OS readouts before going on to be approved. End.Focus on PFS and low toxicity profile.Still optimistic of approval.
539,TGTX,"As investors return from the Thanksgiving-shortened trading week, focus will shift to the U.S. labor market."
540,TGTX,"read the transcript. basically, the FDA is going to ask for OS data; tgtx does not have it; hr is trending toward control (despite the covid related death data); they will ask for a new trial, the CLL indication is pretty much dead.  massive stop losses are being triggered.  this will keep going down unfortunately for those that didn't set stop losses."
541,TGTX,"FWIW, the gap from April 2020 is filled.  With all the bad news in, it could move up after some consolidation.  Strong MS play if nothing else."
542,TGTX,1st thing they‚Äôll need to do is layoff their sales force and reload if and when they get a ms indication. Assuming MS is 18 months away there is no reason to pay an expensive sakes force for dismal indications. CLL is dead they‚Äôll never be able to show OS!
543,TGTX,"Being long, I bought a bit more this morning...  I've had CLL for ten years now,  being on BTK inhibitors (Imbrutinib and Acalabrutinib) over the past three years.  Believe me, don't take toxicity lightly...  I know through my oncologist that the PI3K inhibitors have a reputation - so the caution here....  I remain long..."
544,TGTX,Sorry to see people lose money like this.....these biotechs are so risky. I myself lost a lot of money in biotechs and I lost with TGTX as well although I did sell at $28 .  MW should step down....he has failed the shareholders !
545,TGTX,"No medical reasons for panic. Whenever FDA speaks out loud, Nellies run for cover and hyperventilate. What else is new?"
546,TGTX,So a negotiated SPA with the FDA means nothing?  All primary endpoints met.  This will get past the ODAC meeting.  Just a delay.

549,TGTX,Interesting development today. I like the company for their MS potential and that is my area of knowledge; therefore this seems a buying opportunity.

552,TGTX,Already made 12% off the rebound by buying on the overreaction. Expecting more to come.
553,TGTX,so the BLA (U2) is not the BLA used for MS? Sorry I am confused. A long holder here.

555,OSH,"this would explain the insider selling On November 1, 2021, the Company received a civil investigative demand (‚ÄúCID‚Äù) from the United States Department of Justice.  According to the CID, the Department of Justice is investigating whether the Company may have violated the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 3729-3722. The CID requests certain documents and information related to the Company‚Äôs relationships with third-party marketing agents and related to the Company‚Äôs provision of free transportation to federal health care beneficiaries and requests information and documents related to such matters.  We intend to cooperate with the Department of Justice and produce information and documentation in response to the CID.  We are currently unable to predict the outcome of this investigation or whether litigation is probable. Regardless of the outcome, this inquiry has the potential to have an adverse impact on us due to any related defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies.In addition to the provisions of the FCA, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government.If any of our operations are found to violate these or other government laws or regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price, including:"
556,OSH,"As I outlined in a previous post, I hold a large short position in OSH. At current prices, I will continue to maintain this position. OSH is one of those rare gems that loses even more money the bigger they get. This company will never make money. Their business model was drawn up on a blackboard by some really smart people - the problem is, it's all one grand theory and the narrative is collapsing with each passing quarter. The model only works if they can continue the game of ""upcoming"" their population risk scores to secure higher reimbursement from Medicare. The OIG is on to this scheme, and I believe that OSH (and others in the space) will be held accountable. Even after the recent share price decline, OSH still trades at 5x forward revenues - that multiple only works for high margin/high growth businesses. Even if OSH one day turns a profit, this will never be more than a 5% margin business. If you own OSH shares, sell them. I predict the stock will eventually trade below $20 per share."

597,LSPD,"Let me say something intelligent for once in this board. The 2021 total revenue for LSPD is 221.7 million USD for a market cap of 9.75B. If you compare it to other tech company like Shopify who has a revenue of 2.93 billion USD (2020) and a market cap of 137.41 B (in 2020) then LSPD is way undervalued. Furthermore, according to these calculation the stock is 30% undervalued which makes the stock really worth 86.7 USD (Nasdaq) or 108.8 CAD (TSX). I therefore expect the stock to go up about 30% probably from now to mid March."

The fact is their growth is slowing, they went from an increase of $33.53 M in revenue from Q1 to Q2 and only $17.30M from Q2 to Q3? and the loss isnt one time. they have been consistently losing more $ each time revenues increase? and even facturing in growth, how is 27 times price to sales reasonable??If they are growing in a way to justify this valuation, marketing expenses should be decreasing, You still havent justified how these numbers make sense."" - Ben"

Too many hits.. Soon things will resolve and all that will change.. it is just the nature of things....So calm down.. chill and have faith future will be bright

634,VRM,"Agree that vroom has problems, But every additional last mile hubs they add, its is a proof that in near future it will turn profitable. But no businesses went straight to be a winner.If you have conviction you will remain else you need to find something that is day trade worthy. You wouldn't buy a farm land today and sell it next week because the price went down. You have to do your research before you buy it and stick to it thick and thin, also be greedy when market is fearful"
635,VRM,The chart is looking a lot like Trevor Milton's downhill Nikola paper truck ride.
636,VRM,This has turn out to be a disaster...
637,VRM,"$9, for risk takers. But bankruptcy is not ruled out !!"
638,VRM,Will there ever be a bottom in this?
639,VRM,if you think you are losing big think that Bill Gates has 1% of his portfolio in Vroom.
640,VRM,"Two ways to invest into VRM.. very long term, hoping that it will not reach zero. Short term, having accepted that zero is not too far in the future."
641,VRM,This company is over. So many people lost money.
642,VRM,"Well, it was a given this was a failure.  No way in hell anyone buys a car without test driving it or seeing it in person.  The chances of a scam are worst than going to a used car dealer lot.  But some people just refuse to accept the truth when it comes to money."
643,VRM,"SHORT SHORT SHORT. This company is horrible, i recently tried to purchase a car from them. I was hooked in by thier commercials. This company will go bankrupt. There is no way thier business model will work with how they are executing it. Horrible customer service and they specialize in taking the $250 deposit from ad many customers as possible."
644,VRM,Warning u from long time. I sold all over 50 after recognizing the truth. Since then warning you all
645,VRM,where is the bottom?
646,VRM,WellsFargo maintains buy rating with price target of $45.
647,VRM,"Greg, share price is irrelevant. You are right. Don't worry about it."
648,VRM,"If you invest in an IPO, the data typically suggest you will need to wait 5 + years before things look sunny. With VRM, selling used cars online has to already be a struggle (as the earnings suggest), plus now the market is flooded with these companies. I see no long term success here, the company doesn't really do anything innovate that would suggest to hold any longer."
649,VRM,Vroom is down 8.55% to 13.48
650,VRM,Down 6.58% for today?  Down 56% YTD? No problem.  I am a long term investor.....HHAAA!!!
651,VRM,$CZOO $VRM no love from market
652,VRM,"14.74-0.80 (-5.15%) At close: 04:00PM EST  is Bad News, Good News,  ....Bad news --- drops/s totaling 14.74 will cause this stock to hit 0Good news - it cannot go lower than 0, and may not be a long wait to see 0"
653,VRM,(http://trademarketview.tech) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don't start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
654,CERE,Time to dump CERE before HF. Loading $RVPH in stage 3 schizophrenia trial.
655,CERE,This stock is printing money yet no one is talking about it.
656,CERE,This all because of CFO leaving?
657,CERE,Guys it is very likely it can go down -25%
658,CERE,Glad I shorted this
659,CERE,"I'm not invested with CERE, but I'm getting paddled hard with IMVT. No more big pharma for me."
660,CERE,The CFO probably left because she was told the company is getting bought out and her position would be eliminated.  Just spitballing but she left and didn't sell a share.  Telling.
661,CERE,"I have to say that if she was leaving because of any wrongdoing on her part or if there were financi issues with the company, she would not stay on till October 15 to ensure a good transition. I think the market overreacted. The company has a low debt/equity ratio and has good liquidity. So I am not worried."
662,CERE,Down to $25 soon
663,CERE,I am calling the bottom at $31.
664,CERE,Back to the high 30‚Äôs.  Kathy left for personal reasons.  Not affecting the company.
665,CERE,Got some $20 puts before close‚Ä¶ whose laughing now ;)
666,CERE,"Last 4 days total volume is ~14 million, how can they complete the offering? Will they be filing new one with low price?"
667,CERE,Offerings next days
668,CERE,"That was a lot of volume EOD. We went from 800,000 to 1.6mil in 30min. They pushed it up 2%. I don‚Äôt know how this will end but I think MM‚Äôs are trying to crush 7/16 puts"
669,CERE,Big drop incoming. $18 by Friday.
670,CERE,they need cash.. offering 99% certain
671,CERE,How long it‚Äôs going to take to $20?
672,CERE,Why are my puts down?
673,CERE,Yahoo deleting my post after reading aloud the S-1 Preliminary Filings that show the company saying they don't plan to gerate revenue for years and have only inccured losses since inception.... 52 million for 2021 ended march 31st and 152.1 million net losses for ended december 31st 2020.
